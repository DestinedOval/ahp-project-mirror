* Run the app by opening app.R and clicking 'Run' in the top right hand corner
* `setup.R` contains required packages and is where any data should be read in
* `data` is a folder for storing data to be read in
* `www` contains the app stylesheet and PHS icon images
* `pages` should contain an R script for each tab in your app with the content of that tab. This needs to be linked back to the ui in app.R
* `functions` contains R scripts with functions for the app
